# Libro

**Libro** is a mobile iOS application that allows for easy communication between the main warehouse and individual sales points regarding placing product orders. The application was originally created for my own company â€“ I am currently working on repurposing it into a to-do app. This project is part of my portfolio, showcasing my skills in Swift, UIKit, and Firebase development.

## Features
- User authentication with Firebase Authentication
- Data storage and retrieval from Firebase Cloud Firestore
- Order and product management with interactive UI components
- Custom UI elements (buttons, text fields, order views)
- MVC architecture for structured and scalable code
- Fully programmatic UI layout without Storyboards

## Technologies
- **Swift**
- **UIKit**
- **Firebase (Authentication, Firestore)**
- **MVC** (Model-View-Controller)
